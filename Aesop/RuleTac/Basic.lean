/-! # Rule Tactic Types -/

/--
Input for a rule tactic. Contains:

- `goal`: the goal on which the rule is run.
- `mvars`: the set of mvars which occur in `goal`.
- `indexMatchLocations`: if the rule is indexed, the locations (e.g. hyps or the
  target) matched by the rule's index entries. Otherwise an empty set.
-/
structure RuleTacInput where
  goal : MVarId
  mvars : UnorderedArraySet MVarId
  indexMatchLocations : UnorderedArraySet IndexMatchLocation
  options : Options'
  deriving Inhabited

/--
A single rule application, representing the application of a tactic to the input
goal. Must accurately report the following information:

- `goals`: the goals generated by the tactic.
- `postState`: the `MetaM` state after the tactic was run.
- `scriptBuilder?`: script builder for the tactic. If
  `input.options.generateScript = false` (where `input` is the `RuleTacInput`),
  this field is ignored, so you can use `none`. If the tactic does not support
  script generation, also use `none`.

      if ← goal.isAssignedOrDelayedAssigned then
        return some m!"subgoal metavariable {goal.name} is already assigned."
    return none

end RuleApplication

/--
The result of a rule tactic is a list of rule applications.

/--
A `RuleTac` is the tactic that is run when a rule is applied to a goal.

/--
A `RuleTac` which generates only a single `RuleApplication`.
