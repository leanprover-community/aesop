/--
A `MetaM` version of the `replace` tactic. If `fvarId` refers to the
hypothesis `h`, this tactic asserts a new hypothesis `h : type` with proof
`proof : type` and then tries to clear `fvarId`. Unlike `replaceLocalDecl`,
`replaceFVar` always adds the new hypothesis at the end of the local context.

`replaceFVar` returns the new goal, the `FVarId` of the newly asserted
hypothesis and whether the old hypothesis was cleared.
