To extract a proof, we start in the `MetaM` state in which Aesop was called.
Then we iterate through the proven part of the tree, top to bottom, 'replaying'
the mvar assignments that were performed during the search. This means:

- For each goal `g`, we assign `g`'s pre-norm mvar to the term generated by
  normalisation. If `g` was proved by normalisation, we are done. Otherwise,
  we find the proving child rapp of `g` and descend into it.
- For each rapp `r`, we assign the post-norm mvar of `r`'s parent goal to the
  term generated by `r`. Additionally, we assign each mvar assigned by `r`.
  Then we descend into `r`'s children.
- For each mvar cluster `c`, we find the proven goal of `c` and descend into it.

When we assign a metavariable `m`, we must take some care:

- We must first declare `m` if it is not already declared.
- We must assign (and declare) any metavariables on which the assignment of `m`
  depends. We cannot assume that these assignments are meta-free, since they may
  contain metavariables that were only assigned later during the search. We
  also cannot assume that these are the *only* metavariables occurring in the
  assignments, since they may additionally contain delayed-assigned
  metavariables which depend on the unassigned metavariables.

We also replay env modifications in a similar fashion. We assume that rules only
add declarations to the environment.

If the root goal is not proven, we extract the goals after safe rule
applications. This means we proceed as above, but stop as soon as we reach the
first non-safe rule application. If a goal has multiple safe rule applications,
we arbitrarily choose the first one. (This should happen rarely in practice.)
